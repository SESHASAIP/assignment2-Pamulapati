# new section about algorithm and code fencing
>Algebra began with computations similar to those of arithmetic, with letters standing for numbers.[5] This allowed proofs of properties that are true no matter which numbers are involved. For example, in the quadratic equation quick link to wiki about **algedra**: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra>
The function `Extended Euclidean Algorithm` has the definition
```
 int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
    if (b == 0) {
        x = 1;
        y = 0;
        return a;
    }
    int x1, y1;
    int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
    x = y1;
    y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
    return d;
}
```
